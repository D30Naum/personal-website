# My Personal Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository of my personal website! This project serves as a digital portfolio showcasing my experience, projects, and various ways to contact me as a software developer. The site is built with a keen focus on simplicity, performance, and responsiveness, employing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within the React framework.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create an online presence that effectively highlights my skills, projects, and professional journey. It's designed to be user-friendly, visually appealing, and informative for potential employers, clients, or collaborators who wish to learn more about my work or get in touch.

### Features

- **Skills Section:** Detailed listings of my professional skills, including languages, frameworks, and IDEs.
- **Experience Section:** An interactive showcase of my professional roles over the years, with descriptions and links to live sites or GitHub repositories.
- **Contact Form:** A simple, yet secure form for visitors to leave a message or inquiry.

### Technologies Used
